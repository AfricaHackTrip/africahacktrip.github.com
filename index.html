        <span>
          We are a group of developers &amp; designers from Europe and the United States,
          curious about the emerging African tech hubs we keep hearing about lately.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>We decided to fill the “blank canvas” ourselves, by visiting African tech communities in October 2013. We’ll share our impressions by creating a video documentary.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Our goal is to kick of a continuous exchange with tech communities in Africa.</span>

          <h4>Who are you?</h4>
          <p>
            I'm 28 years old, currently living with my wife in Zurich. I love being a digital nomad, to travel the world, experience new things and make new friends. I'd describe myself as pragmatic and a bit naive, but in a positive way.
          </p>
          <h4>Why are you supporting the project?</h4>
          <p>
            I've read Erik Hersman's Article "From Kenya to Madagascar: The African tech-hub boom" on bbc and wondered, why I worked with designers and developers from all around the globe, despite Africa. When it comes to Web Developement, Africa is a blank canvas to me. I'd like to change that.
          </p>
          <h4>What are your expectations?</h4>
          <p>
            I expect to meet talented and motived developers and designers that use their skills to solve the problems they are surrounded with. I want to learn what these problems are and how they are approaching them. I'm looking forward to some fun hacking with the local creatives and hope that we'll collaborate on projects beyond the trip.
          </p>
          <h4>What are your fears?</h4>
          <p>
            I fear that we might get misunderstood.
          </p>
          <h4>What should be the goal of the AfricaHackTrip?</h4>
          <p>
            Meet local communities. Exchange experiences and ideas. Collaborate on projects. Spread the word.
          </p>
          <h4>What would you like to contribute?</h4>
          <p>
            I want to make it happen. I take responsibility for the overall organization.

            <li>Master in Engineering &amp; Economics</li>
            <li>Worked in Private Sector Development in Ghana</li>
            <li>Spent last 7 years building Startups in Germany with a strong founder team, among others lead an investor-driven E-Commerce startup myself</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Why are you supporting the project?</h4>
          <p>
            I want to understand at what state the African startup scene currently is, what challenges the entrepreneurs face, how they work, what their ideas are
          </p>
          <h4>What are your expectations?</h4>
          <p>
            By working and interacting with entrepreneurs gaining the understanding described above. Also I'd hope to come away with a more open mind to addressing different challenges in entrepreneurship. Finally it would be great to have set a first example for repletion on a regular basis and in other countries.

          <h4>What should be the goal of the AfricaHackTrip?</h4>
          <p>
            Understand and learn from each other. If more is possible, e.g. repetition of a successful event, all the better.
          </p>
          <h4>What would you like to contribute?</h4>
          <p>
            As I have many years of experience building startups from non-tech perspective I can contribute in areas from discussing market viability of an idea, market analysis, pitching, building a reasonably straight forward business plan, brand creation, partner management, team building....

          <h4>Who are you?</h4>
          <p>
            I'm a web frontend and JavaScript app developer from Berlin, Germany. I'm currently freelancing, enjoying working on many exciting projects. I'm also getting involved in the Unhosted project that aims to decentralize personal data on the web and with OpenTechSchool, an organization helping to get new people into the tech industry and teaching tech-related subjects in general.
          </p>
          <h4>Why are you supporting the project?</h4>
          <p>
            I love to travel when there's the chance to really get to know countries and people. Meeting people working in the same industry will be exciting as we will probably have a lot in common and at the same time things will be very different. It's great to see how people from the US and Europe cooperate business-wise and also on not-for-profit and open-source projects. We should do this more around the world. Working together and understanding each other more makes the world a better place.
          </p>
          <h4>What are your expectations?</h4>
          <p>
            I expect to meet interesting people, find out about the countries and cities we're going to visit and of course about cool projects in the tech industry. I hope to learn new ways how to approach solving real-world problems and I hope people are also interested to find out about how we do things.
          </p>
          <h4>What are your fears?</h4>
          <p>
            That we are not able to communicate our intentions. We do not want to be simply visitors. Or even worse, a delegation of people to show “them” how to do things “right”.
          </p>
          <h4>What should be the goal of the AfricaHackTrip?</h4>
          <p>
            Connecting communities. Sharing ideas. Promoting cool projects.Telling everyone by publishing all this.
          </p>
          <h4>What would you like to contribute?</h4>
          <p>
            I can help with documentation (video, sound, photos, blog) and I'm happy to take care for our stay in Uganda.

            I'm super excited about just seeing what the tech scene is like in a part of the world where I -unknowingly- haven't expected to find such communities.

          <h4>Who are you?</h4>
          <p>
            I'm an artist and designer living with my wife Caitlin in San Francisco. I attended Plymouth State University in New Hampshire and Kendall College of Art &amp; Design in Grand Rapids, Michigan. As an eagle scout I developed a deep appreciation for socially conscientious projects. I worked with The Salvation Army in Grand Rapids as a web and social media manager. I moved to San Francisco in 2010 to accept an inaugural fellowship with Code for America, a world-recognized non-profit that works to bring open-source culture to American government. I currently works as a prototype engineer for Granicus, a provider of government-related software. I fantasize about owning an entire litter of puppies.
          </p>
          <h4>Why are you supporting the project?</h4>
          <p>
            The Africa Hack Trip is a great way for me to spread my new love of open-source. I love meeting new people in new places and the trip affords me an excellent way to tap into all these passions. My experience with Code for America really got me thinking about ways to envolve the rest of the world in creating a place where we can think and share in new, creative ways. I can't wait to see what come out of the hack-a-thons and better yet, the friends I'm sure to make.

          <h4>What are your expectations?</h4>
          <p>
            I'm trying to stay open-minded. Expecting the best while not expecting anything specific. I just want to get involved in what's being built out there, helping out any way I can. I know designers are in short supply in the open-source community so I'm excited to be an asset.
          </p>
          <h4>What are your fears?</h4>
          <p>
            Malaria, nobody wants that mess.
          </p>
          <h4>What should be the goal of the AfricaHackTrip?</h4>
          <p>
            I think it would be great to see one or more of the apps find funding and take off as a real endeavor. Making connections and building a network will make the trip sustainable for future iterations and will be a big part of the success.
          </p>
          <h4>What would you like to contribute?</h4>
          <p>
            I've been shopping around an app and applied to the latest Knight News Challenge (<a href="//kng.ht/PvsSI7">kng.ht/PvsSI7</a>). I'll be working on building this out and possibly recruiting some help where I sense an interest. The product is designed specifically for urban areas in developing countries and it's a great place to do "market research".

          <h4>Who are you?</h4>
          <p>
            I’m a nomadic interaction designer, advisor &amp; educator. Sharing, remixing and freedom are very important to me, so I mostly work on open source web projects like ownCloud, Unhosted and Remotestorage.
          </p>
          <h4>Why are you supporting the project?</h4>
          <p>
            I know the tech communities in cities like Berlin, San Francisco, Tel Aviv and collaborate with many people from various countries. But I found I know little about what’s going on in Africa and don’t really work with people from there. Apparently most major tech hubs there all started in the last two years. I want to see what is relevant for people there and what we can do together.
          </p>
          <h4>What are your expectations?</h4>
          <p>
            Now I read a bit about what is going on there, and it’s very similar to elsewhere. Hackerspaces, Makerspaces, so I think there’s lots of opportunity for working together.
          </p>
          <h4>What are your fears?</h4>
          <p>
            I fear we might forget something important during organization.
          </p>
          <h4>What should be the goal of the AfricaHackTrip?</h4>
          <p>
            Establish long-lasting connections between the different tech communities. And most importantly to document everything so it’s not just a one-time trip, but informative for everyone.
          </p>
          <h4>What would you like to contribute?</h4>
          <p>
            I like connecting people and have experience organizing usergroups and meetups. As well as events with more of a cultural focus, like the Unhosted unconference in the small Czech town of Unhost, and Hackerbeach in Vietnam.

          <p>
            I like the feeling that comes when you find a really elegant solution to a problem that has been bugging you for a while. That comes with programming quite regularly which is why I like this job. Besides that I enjoy food, sailing, traveling and reading. Currently I live in Berlin, but in the last couple of years I have had the chance to live in a couple of other amazing places.
          </p>
          <h4>Why are you supporting the project?</h4>
          <p>
            Africa seems to be the least visited continent among my friends and also one I haven't been to yet. I believe this is a great opportunity to get to know very different cultures and judging my recent articles an interesting tech scene.
          </p>
          <h4>What are your expectations?</h4>
          <p>
            I hope to get to know new people and maybe have the chance to experience new perspectives on life and technology.
          </p>
          <h4>What are your fears?</h4>
          <p>
            To get stomach troubles.
          </p>
          <h4>What should be the goal of the AfricaHackTrip?</h4>
          <p>
            I am not sure it's possible and I don't think it makes sense to limit AfricaHackTrip to one goal. Most likely everyone will have their own goals. In general it would be nice to be able to learn from each other and form a connection.
          </p>
          <h4>What would you like to contribute?</h4>
          <p>
            Whatever I can really. Hopefully some coding and maybe some organizational skills.
