  <h2>
    Why Sponsor?
  </h2>

  <p>
    AfricaHackTrip will organize four hack events in four locations reaching hundreds of developers. At the end of our trip we will be present at
    <a href="http://www.demo-africa.com/">
      DEMO Africa
    </a>
    , the continent's largest startup event. We will be filming throughout our journey and release a documentary about our experiences when we get back.
  </p>

  <p>
    As our sponsor you will be visible to everyone we meet: startups, developers and other forward-thinking people in a new market with huge growth potential.
  </p>

  <p>
    Part of our mission is to find out how African hackers work and what tools they use. We will share that information with you, giving you new insights that you can use to market your products to the African countries.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition you will support a great cause. With our trip we aim to bring the development communities of the global North closer together with the ones in African countries, enabling collaboration and learning on both sides.
  </p>
