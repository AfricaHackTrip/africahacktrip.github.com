### Why do you want to participate?

I've read Erik Hersman's Article "[From Kenya to Madagascar: The African tech-hub boom](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18878585)" on bbc and wondered, why I worked with designers and developers from all around the globe, despite Africa. When it comes to Web Developement, Africa is a blank canvas to me. I'd like to change that.

### What are your expectations?

I expect to meet talented and motived developers and designers that use their skills to solve the problems they are surrounded with. I want to learn what these problems are and how they are approaching them. I'm looking forward to some fun hacking with the local creatives and hope that we'll collaborate on projects beyond the trip. 

### What are your fears?

I fear that we might get misunderstood. 

### What should be the goal of the AfricaHackTrip?

Meet local communities. Exchange experiences and ideas. Collaborate on projects. Spread the word back home.

### What would you like to contribute?

I want to make it happen. I take responsibility for the overall organization. 

### Tell us about yourself.

I'm 28, currently living with my wife in Zurich. I love being a digital nomad, to travel the world, experience new things and make new friends. I'd describe myself as pragmatic and a bit naive, but in a positive way.
