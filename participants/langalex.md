None. Let's just go and see.

### What are your fears?

Safety?

### What should be the goal of the AfricaHackTrip?

Learn. Meet people. Bring that back home. Connect.

### Tell us about yourself.

I started my own web development company [Upstream](http://upstre.am) in 2006. In 2008 we added a coworking space called [co.up](http://co-up.de) and in 2010 we released [Cobot](http://cobot.me), a coworking space management software.

I mostly work too much but when I don't I go indoor climbing, I go on [sailing trips](http://alex.io/tagged/transatlantic) and I make small [films](http://vimeo.com/langalex).
