### What's your name and job title?

My name is Frank Prößdorf and I am a freelance software developer from Berlin.

###  Why do you want to participate?

Africa seems to be the least visited continent among my friends and also one I haven't been to yet. I believe this is a great opportunity to get to know very different cultures and judging my recent articles an interesting tech scene.

### What are your expectations?

I hope to get to know new people and maybe have the chance to experience new perspectives on life and technology.

### What are your fears?

To get stomach troubles.

### What should be the goal of the AfricaHackTrip? Should there be one?

I am not sure it's possible and I don't think it makes sense to limit AfricaHackTrip to one goal. Most likely everyone will have their own goals. In general it would be nice to be able to learn from each other and form a connection.

### What would you like to contribute?

Whatever I can really. Hopefully some coding and maybe some organizational skills.

### Tell us a about yourself.

I like the feeling that comes when you find a really elegant solution to a problem that has been bugging you for a while. That comes with programming quite regularly which is why I like this job. Besides that I enjoy food, sailing, traveling and reading. Currently I live in Berlin, but in the last couple of years I have had the chance to live in a couple of other amazing places.
