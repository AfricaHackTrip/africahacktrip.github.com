### Why do you want to participate?

The Africa Hack Trip is a great way for me to spread my new love of open-source. I love meeting new people in new places and the trip affords me an excellent way to tap into all these passions. My experience with Code for America really got me thinking about ways to envolve the rest of the world in creating a place where we can think and share in new, creative ways. I can't wait to see what come out of the hack-a-thons and better yet, the friends I'm sure to make.

### What are your expectations?

I'm trying to stay open-minded. Expecting the best while not expecting anything specific. I just want to get involved in what's being built out there, helping out any way I can. I know designers are in short supply in the open-source community so I'm excited to be an asset.

### What are your fears?

Malaria, nobody wants that mess.

### What should be the goal of the AfricaHackTrip? Should there be one?

I think it would be great to see one or more of the apps find funding and take off as a real endeavor. Making connections and building a network will make the trip sustainable for future iterations and will be a big part of the success.

### What would you like to contribute?

I've been shopping around an app and applied to the latest Knight News Challenge (kng.ht/PvsSI7). I'll be working on building this out and possibly recruiting some help where I sense an interest. The product is designed specifically for urban areas in developing countries and it's a great place to do "market research".
 
### Tell us about yourself.

I'm an artist and designer living with my wife Caitlin in San Francisco. I attended Plymouth State University in New Hampshire and Kendall College of Art & Design in Grand Rapids, Michigan. As an eagle scout I developed a deep appreciation for socially conscientious projects. I worked with The Salvation Army in Grand Rapids as a web and social media manager. I moved to San Francisco in 2010 to accept an inaugural fellowship with Code for America, a world-recognized non-profit that works to bring open-source culture to American government. I currently works as a prototype engineer for Granicus, a provider of government-related software. I fantasize about owning an entire litter of puppies.
